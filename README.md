# React + Vite Project Starter Kit

Welcome to the React Project Starter Kit documentation! This guide will help you set up and start a new React project quickly. Follow the steps below to get your project up and running.

- Node.js: Download and Install Node.js
- npm (Node Package Manager): npm comes with Node.js, so no need for a separate installation.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**

```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-react-project.git
cd your-react-project
```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
```
npm i
```

3. **Start Server**
```
npm run dev
```


## Available Scripts

1. **Start Development Server:**

```
npm run dev

````

- This command runs the app in development mode. Open http://localhost:5173/ to view it in the browser.

2. **Build for Production:**
```
npm run build
```
- Builds the app for production to the build folder. The build is minified and optimized for better performance.

3. **Run Tests:**

```
npm run test
```
- Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.


## Project Structure

The project structure is organized as follows:

1. **public**: Static assets and the index.html file.

2. **src**: Source code for your React application.
- **components**: Reusable React components.
- **styles** : CSS or other styling files.
- **App.js**: Main component where your app starts.
3.  **index.js**: Entry point for your React application.


#### Feel free to organize and modify the structure based on your project's needs.
